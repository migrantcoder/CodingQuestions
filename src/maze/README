Generate and Explore a Maze

Problem Definition

A maze is a grid of 4 sided rooms. Rooms may be connected to their neighbours by
doors.  One room is an exit.  Implement functions to generate a maze, find a
path from a specified start room to the exit, mark a path, and print a maze
(including indicating the exit) and a path if marked.

Representation

The maze is represented by a 2-dimensional (row by columns) array of room
objects.  The first row is the top of the maze and the first column is the left
of the maze.

Each room object has a bitfield indicating whether it has doors to any of its
up, right, down and left neighbours.  A room object may also be marked as being
the exit, the start of a path to the exit and being on the path to the exit.

Solution

To generate a maze, start at the specified exit room.  Perform a depth first
exploration of the grid tracking visited rooms and creating doors between the
rooms being traversed.  Backtrack when no move can be made from the current
room, i.e. the room is surrounded by maze edges and visited rooms.

Recursive and iterative implementations of depth first search are used to find
a path to the exit from the specified start room.
