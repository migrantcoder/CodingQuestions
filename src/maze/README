Generate and Explore a Maze

Definition

A maze is a grid of 4 sided rooms that may be connected to their neighbours
by doors.  One room is marked as the exit

Generation & Representation

The maze is represented by a 2-dimensional (row by columns) array of room
objects.  The first (zeroeth) row is the top of the maze and the first
(zeroeth) columns is the left of the maze.

Each room object indicates whether it has doors to any of its up, right,
down and left neighbours.  Rooms track other metadata, such as whether they
have been visited during or are on a path.

To generate a maze, start at a specified exit room.  Perform a depth first
exploration of the grid marking nodes as visited as they are encountered and
creating doors between the rooms being traversed.  Backtrack when no move
can be made from the current room, the room is surrounded by maze edges and
visited rooms.

Find Exit

A recursive depth first search is used to find a path to the exit from the
specified start room.  A separate mark path function will mark the path on
the grid.
