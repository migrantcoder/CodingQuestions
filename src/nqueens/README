N Queens

Problem Definition

A generalizeation of the 8 queens problem where 8 queens must be placed on an
8x8 square chessboard such that no queen is able to take any other. Queens can
move horizontally, vertically or diagonally.

Representation

The board is represented by an N dimensional array of rows. Each row is
represented by a bitmap, specifically an unsigned integer of at least 2N bits.
Rows and columns are 0 indexed. The Nth least significant bit of a row bitmap
represents the 0th column. E.g. for N=8 the 8th least significant bit (the bit
in position 7) represents column 0 and the least significant bit represents
column 7.

The 2N bits width requirement is for implementation convenience - it prevents
bits from being dropped on left shifts when validating diagonals on the board.

Solution

The solution is implemented using recursive backtracking. To place a queen on
the current row, a recursive call is made with a queen placed on each potential
column on the row to attempt to place a queen on the next row. Each candidate
queen placement is validated to ensure no currently placed queens conflict.
