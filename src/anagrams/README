Find Anagrams

Problem Statement

Given a list of words, return only the words that are anagrams of other words in
the list. Return them in the order they appear in the list. There are no
duplicates

Solution

Words are canonicalized by sorting their letters. Thus the canonicalizations of
anagrams are equal. Create a table of canonicalized word occurrence counts.
Remove all members with a count less than 2 from the table. Filter out words
from the original list who's conicalized version is not in the table.
